# Changelog

### `Initial Release`
# **Version 1.0**
Stockpile Savings helps you save money by encouraging you to buy more of your regularly purchased items when they are on sale. This saves you money on items you were going to buy later on anyways.

LIFETIME SAVINGS
Stockpile Savings allows you to keep track your sale purchases. Just enter the product description, product expiration date, consumption data, pricing, and units purchased. Stockpile Savings adds up each individual purchase to provide your lifetime savings.

MAXIMUM STOCKPILE QUANTITY
Enter daily, weekly, or monthly consumption of the product along with its expiration date to compute the maximum stockpile quantity. This quantity helps you determine the most you could purchase without having the products expire prior to consumption.
